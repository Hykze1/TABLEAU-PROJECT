1. Introduction

Airbnb 2016 Dataset

This is my first data visualization project portfolio using TABLEAU tool as newbie in the data-tech space. 

I will start by introducing the data set

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. 

Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through 

Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, 

business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, 

implementation of innovative additional services and much more. 

2. Data Description

The dataset was sourced from kaggle. The csv file contains 

Table	Total     Rows Total	    Columns

Calendar      	1048575	        4

Listings      	3818	          92

Reviews       	84849           6

LISTINGS contains Actual home that Airbnb is renting out, their location details, types of properties, their price per/week/day/month and bunch of financial data etc 

REVIEWS basically contains COMMENTS about Airbnb services 

CALENDAR contains days property was taken or rented out with the cost and the day no property was rented out 

Data Objective
‚Ä¢	Analyze and explore data ü§ù
‚Ä¢	Data Visualization ü§ù

1. Used case
Someone wants to starts a Airbnb business and he/she wants to know where to buy a home, put it up on Airbnb and start renting it out.

So some of the thing he/she will be looking out will be bedroom, location, how much pricing is he/she going to get and how much pricing will he/she charge. 

This is important so he/she can make the most profit

So here you will find the area where they charge the most.[ from highest to lowest]

This is another area where or how u can view areas where they charge the most [ on the map]

2. Used case
He/she is thinking of listing it on Airbnb but also want to leave it. so he/she wants to know the best time to put it on the market for people to be able to use
So I will start by looking ‚Äúwhen are people spending most money on Airbnb‚Äù?

![T2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100960483/229289719-51e6001b-9ad1-4287-a81f-7b5952ed776d.png)

So with this chat we can see that people travels a lot over the summer hence over the summer is when he/she can rent out on Airbnb 


3. Used case

The amount of bedroom will definitely affect the pricing of the actual Airbnb

The larger the house the more the bedroom the its gonna cost 

Looking at the chat below you can see that the larger the bedroom the more the money he/she would make. 
Therefore, the larger bedroom gives a larger return

4. Used case

So he/she wants to know he/her competition especially as it concerns the bedroom

We just want to know how many listing are there

So the more we go up the more and more the competition.

In conclusion, the more you look into the data the more questions arises. 
Here is the final DASHBOARD DISPLAY
